Job Name: Finish the Iteration 1 of Perzo Home Page 
Price: $55/hr 
Description:

1. We have decided to get merge First and Last Name field into one; this will save us one row which we will make good use of

2. We need to add Terms and Condition sentence in Sing UP tab - let's implement it the same model as Facebook did (http://www.facebook.com/r.php By clicking Sign Up, you agree to our Terms and that you have read our Data Use Policy, including our Cookie Use.)

3. We need to have Sign up with F/L/T and Goggle (this is missing) only with small icons again to save space and be sleek in the Sign Up tab

4. We need to have Login with F/L/T/G again with small icons

5. We need to have remember me check box in the login tab

6. Add Â© to Copyright

7. Add a language selector at the bottom, English only for the time being ;-)

8. I have JS scripts to validate respective inputs which I will send you. The goal is not to send anything to the server without a receiving all mandatory fields and all of them are mandatory and b- without validating the received input from the user - see http://perzohometest1.appspot.com/

9. We need to add tool tips for each field

10. Add a link for "Forgot my password"

11. Add a cookie so that when the user has registered the next time the browser is at the home page he or she sees login tab

12. The hardest input to validate is the phone number to help with that i want to implement a field where the user selects the flag and along with the country name on left side of the same field then enters the phone number which we validate using the script above and send it to the server

13. We need a slight variation of this page until we are in beta. Until that time this modified home page will have Request for access to beta instead of sign up tab and we will only have there User Name and email input again along with validation. We will still keep the home page of course but it will be parked into a different url until we are ready.

14. For the password field instead of having in input characters not shown we would like to have the same method as the iphone where you the charactere you type and when you go the next one you don't see it any more

15. We need landing pages for all the links we point to: About US, Jobs, Blog etc... I mean actual web pages which we will fill with actual text content this week-end.

16. Mike has already implemented the back-end for sign up and login with social networks. We will discuss this today as we will need to specify better how we will represent this to the user (skin or not) and what data we will retrieve into Perzo DB from these networks.

17. We need like on Facebook thing somewhere...
