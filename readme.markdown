Tasks for today
---------------

1. Modify the header banner across the whole screen with appropriate style sheet you can embed in one the css files (create a new style), with a link on the Perzo logo (placeholder graphic is fine) to the home page.

2. Fix the video and register box: 
- Put the video and tabs into one visible box instead of the current configuration
- Get rid of Sign-up and Login icons and replace them with something more meaningful
- Arrange the way sign-up and login tabs display: no white background, better layout of signup and login tab, no sliding down, similar sizes, find a place to put the login with facebook (we will add here login with LinkedIn, Google and Twitter)

3. Modify the footer where I would like to see:
- Left: Facebook, G+, Twitter, Youtube icons with pointers 
- Center: Copyright
- Right: Home|About Us|Blog|Jobs|Legal
Footer must be anchored at the bottom even if users scroll

Don't hesitate to be creative to fix the layout.

Bonus is making login with Facebook and Google work

The site must be deployed and testable on GAE.
