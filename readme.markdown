Job Name: Finish the Iteration 1 of Perzo Home Page 
Price: $55/hr 
Description:

3. We need to have Sign up with F/L/T and Goggle (this is missing) only with small icons again to save space and be sleek in the Sign Up tab

4. We need to have Login with F/L/T/G again with small icons

7. Add a language selector at the bottom, English only for the time being ;-)

8. I have JS scripts to validate respective inputs which I will send you. The goal is not to send anything to the server without a receiving all mandatory fields and all of them are mandatory and b- without validating the received input from the user - see http://perzohometest1.appspot.com/

9. We need to add tool tips for each field

12. The hardest input to validate is the phone number to help with that i want to implement a field where the user selects the flag and along with the country name on left side of the same field then enters the phone number which we validate using the script above and send it to the server

13. We need a slight variation of this page until we are in beta. Until that time this modified home page will have Request for access to beta instead of sign up tab and we will only have there User Name and email input again along with validation. We will still keep the home page of course but it will be parked into a different url until we are ready.

16. Mike has already implemented the back-end for sign up and login with social networks. We will discuss this today as we will need to specify better how we will represent this to the user (skin or not) and what data we will retrieve into Perzo DB from these networks.

17. We need like on Facebook thing somewhere...
